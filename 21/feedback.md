What was great:
  * wide range of covered topics (modal logics, categories, proovers, etc.)
  * side activities (games, barbeque, singings, etc.)
  * tea and snacks

What was missing:
  * no systemic feedback collection
  * no prerequisites for basic VS advanced prep courses (so hard to choose)
  * preparatory courses were not recorded
  * no freezbee (AAAAAAARGH)
  * some lectures were missing in "Методички" page (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1NSJlC6F0OmPBOZC47QAiWRIS4NF5pXSA)
  * no lectures on separation logic and SMT-solvers
  * a crib with a list needed stuff (e.g. cups)
  * calendar events lacked links to corresponding materials (abstracts, etc.)

What caused problems:
  * volatile schedule
    * schedule in Google doc was constantly changing without notice
    * schedule in Google doc didn't match the schedule in Google calendar
    * my talk has been removed _twice_ despite confirming with organizers the day before
  * few people knew how to setup/reboot camera which caused lecture startup delays
    * a short instruction on website would solve this
