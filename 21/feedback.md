What was missing:
  * list of needed stuff (e.g. cups)
  * no systemic feedback collection
  * no prerequisites for basic VS advanced prep courses (so hard to choose)
  * no video recording
  * no freezbee (AAAAAAARGH)

What caused problems:
  * volatile schedule (my talk has been moved despite confirming with organizers the day b4)
