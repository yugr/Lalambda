What was missing:
  * list of needed stuff (e.g. cups)
  * no systemic feedback collection
  * no prerequisites for basic VS advanced prep courses (so hard to choose)
  * no video recording
  * no freezbee (AAAAAAARGH)
  * some lectures were missing in "Методички" page (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1NSJlC6F0OmPBOZC47QAiWRIS4NF5pXSA)

What caused problems:
  * volatile schedule
    * schedule in Google doc was constantly changing without notice
    * schedule in Google doc didn't match the schedule in Google calendar
    * my talk has been removed despite confirming with organizers the day before
